		"shortInfo": "Ter Stegen kept the most clean sheets in Europe last season, if only because he didn't have all that much to do. This year, he's been tested more often — and has mostly stood up to the challenge. A back injury has him out until January. His return will be crucial if Barca are to work their way back into the title race."

		"shortInfo": "Gundogan was always going to be a reliable role player for Barca, a plug-and-play option in any of the Blaugrana's four midfield spots. But he's turned out to be so much more. With Gavi out long-term, Gundogan has filled a more rugged role and he's happy to do the dirty work. If his teammates had been more reliable in crucial areas, he would have a few assists to his name too."

		"shortInfo": "Xavi has a Kounde problem. He was a solid right-back last season, despite openly disliking the position. So far this campaign, he's been tried both on the right and in the middle, while making mistakes in both positions. Perhaps he will never be a perfect fit for either."

		"shortInfo": "At the end of last season, Balde looked like the best left-back in Europe. The teenager had established a perfect role for the Balugrana, marauding up the left flank, and serving as a key chance creator for a Barca side that strolled to the league title. But something has happened this season, and Balde has fallen out of the XI altogether. Most recently, he was deployed as a centre-back against Girona. Something is wrong..."

		"shortInfo": "The drop off? Father time winning? A mini slump? It's not quite clear what is happening to Lewandowski this year. He has still found the net at a decent enough rate, but his general play is concerning. Barca's star man is missing chances in spades, and has looked sluggish at times. Perhaps that's just what happens when you hit your mid thirties."

		"shortInfo": "Christensen was arguably the best free agent signing in La Liga last season, establishing a formidable centre-back partnership with Ronald Araujo. But he hasn't really kicked on since then. A few knocks, compounded by inconsistent playing time have seen his levels drop slightly. He can still be class, but will need an extended run in the side to prove it."

		"shortInfo": "Cancelo has endured a mixed start to his Barca career. Certainly, his role in Barca's comeback win over Celta Vigo will go down in club history as one of the great performances. But outside of that, questions have to be asked about his exact fit. Xavi has used him in both full-back slots, as well as in central midfield, without seeing him succeed outright in any position."

		"age": "31",
		"number": "18",
		"image": "romeu.webp",
		"shortInfo": "What exactly was Romeu supposed to be? The Barcelona academy player could never replace Sergio Busquets. The expectation was, perhaps, that he could function in the same way, providing the muscle at the base of the Barca midfield. However, his lack of pace, and non-existent agility has been costly. Once a nailed-down starter, he has fallen out of favour. There's a reason he couldn't crack the line-up 10 years ago..."

		"position": "FW",
		"age": "16",
		"number": "27",
		"image": "ter-stegen.webp",
		"shortInfo": "It's hard to keep expectation levels low with Yamal. The winger has been among Barca's best players this season - and he's still just 16 years old. A devastating dribbler with an eye for a key pass, the product of La Masia is the perfect right-winger for this Barca team. It's important to look after him, but Yamal has perhaps been too protected. The Blaugrana's attack is inconsistent, and Yamal seems to make a difference whenever he's on. More minutes should be in order."

		"player": "Frenkie de Jong",
		"nation": "NED",

		"age": "26",
		"number": "21",
		"image": "de-jong.webp",
		"shortInfo": "Finally, De Jong is playing like the midfielder Barcelona were promised back in 2019. The Dutchman has bossed it in the middle of the park this year, pulling the strings for a side that otherwise looked to be lacking in rhythm. An ankle sprain stalled his progress, but he's taken no time to recapture his best upon his return. Xavi must hope, however, that De Jong and sporting director Deco can sort out their differences quickly, following reports of an angry confrontation this week."

	{
		"player": "João Félix",
		"nation": "POR",
		"position": "FW",
		"age": "23",
		"number": "14",
		"image": "felix.webp",
		"shortInfo": "Lewandowski lamented Barcelona's lack of attacking quality earlier this season, taking to the press to criticise Xavi's tactics. The answer, it turns out, was to sign a player who does little else but attack. Felix has been instrumental in Barca's play, always involved and scoring some key goals. He's not always the most effective — and can disappear for long periods — but Barca would be far worse without him. A luxury player has become a vital one."

		"age": "23",
		"number": "7",
		"image": "ferran.webp",
		"shortInfo": "What a confusing player. Torres is undeniably impactful off the bench, and has seven goal contributions to his name, but he can't get anything going when thrown into the starting XI. For now, he has the manager's trust. Still, it's hard to justify his hefty price tag."

	{
		"player": "Ronald Araújo",
		"nation": "URU",
		"position": "DF",

		"number": "4",
		"image": "araujo.webp",
		"shortInfo": "Is there, consistently, a better centre-back in La Liga? Araujo may have made the odd mistake this campaign - it seems that everyone in the Blaugrana backline has - but he still spends the majority of games functioning as the dominant defender that anchors this Barca team. A world class player."

		"age": "26",
		"number": "11",
		"image": "raphina.webp",
		"shortInfo": "Raphinha started his season in miserable fashion, swinging an elbow at an opposing defender against Getafe, and serving a three-match ban as a result. He has improved since then, and has chipped in with six goal contributions. But Xavi would likely want to see more from a player entrusted with regular starts."

		"position": "MF",
		"age": "31",
		"number": "20",
		"image": "roberto.webp",
		"shortInfo": "Xavi has repeatedly stuck up for Roberto, insisting that his vice-captain can deputise in a number of key roles. That may be true, but it's unclear which ones he actually functions in. Roberto doesn't offer the creativity of Pedri, finesse of Frenkie de Jong, or physicality of Oriol Romeu. And these days, he lacks the legs to make up for it. Rumours are swirling about a potential move to MLS — a switch that might be in everyone's interest."

		"shortInfo": "Fermin didn't seem likely to be around the Barca squad in June, but a series of impressive showings in preseason - including a wonderstrike against Real Madrid - forced him into the picture. After a solid start, the academy product has slowed down, seeing his minutes shrink as Barca's fixtures get tougher. Does Xavi trust him anymore?"

Pedri isn't quite at his best, but a few weeks after re-establishing himself in Xavi's side, he's starting to look more like the vital creative presence of old. Now it's time to stay on the pitch..."
